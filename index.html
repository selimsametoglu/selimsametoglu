        Who is Selim? "I am a PhD candidate with a focus on leveraging data from social media and use this in genetically informative designs. I primarily make use of machine learning models (e.g., natural language processing, image to text, and cascaded/combined models) to assess wellbeing of individuals. I am also interested in situations where researchers only have limited access to labeled datasets (i.e., transfer learning)."
